                  Revv allows up to 125 km/hr. However it is 80 km/hr in a few cities where some cars might be equipped with speed 
                  governors as per government directives. Revv strictly advises to follow local speed limits.

            Taking a Revv Hyundai subscription in these times is the smartest decision you can take for your family so 
            that you can avoid the hassles and unsafe environment of the public transport. While the Hyundai cars are well known 
            for their reliability and comfort with a mix of cutting-edge features, 
            the Revv subscription of Hyundai cars provide the customers with access to the most popular Hyundai models. 
        </p> 
        <p>
            The cars are thoroughly sanitized both inside and outside before the delivery, to eliminate any chance of contamination from 
            any surface of the car. The Revv team members would also be wearing full 
            Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) while delivering the sanitized Hyundai cars for subscription by Revv to your doorstep.

            your money into buying it. Hyundai subscription by Revv comes at a reasonable pricing model, so that the amount you 
            pay as the rental is lesser than the down-payment, EMIs, Insurance, Road Tax and Maintenance 
            amount taken together. All these facilities are, however, fully inclusive in the Hyundai subscription by Revv.

            While you save yourself from paying for each of the services separately, you can also change to a different 
            car make-model later if you get bored of it and decide to go for a different car. While the minimum Hyundai subscription India 
            period is 12 months, you can reduce this period of subscription and move out of the contract anytime by paying a pre 
            closure penalty amount. 
            There is also a buy-out option in case you fall in love with the car and decide to buy it.
